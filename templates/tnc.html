                    By using this app, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. If you don't agree with any part of these Terms, please donâ€™t use the app. It's as simple as that.

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    This app is a personal learning project. While itâ€™s designed to be useful, itâ€™s not a commercial product just yet. There may be bugs, quirks, and features that need more work. Think of it like a prototypeâ€”use it at your own risk, and donâ€™t expect perfection just yet. ðŸ˜‰

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    While this app is for learning purposes, security is still very important to me! All the data you enter here is encrypted. I canâ€™t see your passwords or any other sensitive information. Your privacy and security are important to me, and Iâ€™m always working to improve how everything works behind the scenes.

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    This app is a learning project, so there are no guarantees. If it breaks or loses your data, Iâ€™ll feel bad about it, but I canâ€™t take responsibility for any issues that arise. You use the app at your own risk, and I encourage you to back up your data (a little tech wisdom for you!).

                    You agree to use the app for educational purposes only and not to misuse or attempt to hack the app. Be kind, respectful, and follow the general principle of "donâ€™t break things." If you find any bugs, let me knowâ€”Iâ€™m happy to learn from my mistakes!

                    Your data is important to me. While Iâ€™ve set up the app to keep your information safe and encrypted, I encourage you to read my <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how your data is handled.

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Iâ€™m doing my best to make this app secure, but because itâ€™s still a personal learning project, I canâ€™t guarantee that everything will work perfectly. I am not responsible for any loss of data, inconvenience, or other damages that might occur while using this app. So, just a friendly reminder to back up anything importantâ€”just in case!

                    I may update these Terms from time to time as I continue to learn and improve the app. If I make any changes, Iâ€™ll post them here, and youâ€™ll see the updated date at the top. By continuing to use the app after changes, youâ€™re agreeing to the updated Terms (so stay tuned for any changes).
